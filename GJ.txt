Theme: Deeper and deeper

Ideas
-----

1. You have to go deeper and deeper into a cave. You have a lantern that keeps running out and must be kept alight or you fail the game

	
	
	
	
	

	
	
	
	//Must implement
	. Main mechanic to keep lantern alight, when light dies, you die.
	. You must loot dead explorers to find lamp oil to keep your lantern running
	. At the end of each segment is a rople/ladder that decends down into the next area. Next area is selected randomly from pre-made prefabs
	
	//Possibly implement
	. Puzzles to proceed to next area 
	. Enemies
